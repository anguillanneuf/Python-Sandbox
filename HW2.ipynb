    "In this assignment, we will use machine learning techniques to perform data analysis and learn models about our data. We will use a real world music dataset from [Last.fm](http://last.fm) for this assignment. There are two parts to this assignment: In the first part we will look at Unsupervised Learning with clustering and in the second part, we will study Supervised Learning. The play data (and user/artist matrix) comes from the [Last.fm 1K Users dataset](http://www.dtic.upf.edu/~ocelma/MusicRecommendationDataset/lastfm-1K.html), while the tags come from [the Last.fm Music Tags dataset](http://musicmachinery.com/2010/11/10/lastfm-artisttags2007/). You won't have to interact with these datasets directly, because we've already preprocessed them for you.\n",

    "Machine learning is a branch of artifical intelligence where we try to find hidden structure within data. \n",
    "For example, lets say you are hired as a data scientist at a cool new music playing startup. You are given access to \n",
    "logs from the product and are asked find out what kinds of music are played on your website and how you can promote songs that will be \n",
    "popular. In this case we wish to extract some structure from the raw data we have using machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main kinds of machine learning algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Unsupervised Learning - is the branch where we don't have any ground truth (or labeled data) that can help our training process. There are many approaches to unsupervised learning which includes topics like Clustering,  Mixture Models, Hidden Markov Models etc. In this assignment we will predominantly look at clustering.\n",
    "2. Supervised Learning - we have training data which is labeled (either manually or from historical data) and we try to make predictions about those labels on new, unlabeled, data. There are similarly several approaches to supervised learning - various classification and regression techniques all the way up to Support Vector Machines and Convolutional Neural Networks. In this assignment we'll explore two regression algorithms - Least Squares Linear Regression and Regression Trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the techniques you'll be using (like testing on a validation set) are of critical importance to the modeling process, regardless of the technique you're using, so keep these in mind in your future modeling efforts."

    "Your assignment is to use machine learning algorithms for two tasks on a real world music dataset from Last.fm. The goal in the first part is to cluster artists and try to discover all artists that belong a certain genre. In the second part, we'll use the same dataset and attempt to predict how popular a song will be based on a number of features of that song. One component will involve incorporating cluster information into the models."

    "*scikit-learn* does a number of things very well, but one of the things it doesn't handle easily is categorical or missing data. Categorical data is data that can take on a finite set of values, e.g. a categorical variable might be the color of a stop light (Red, Yellow, Green), this is in contrast with continuous variables like real numbers in the range -Infinity to +Infinity. There is another common type of data called \"ordinal\" that can be thought of as categorical data that has a natural ordering, like: Cold, Warm, Hot. We won't be dealing with this kind of data here, but having that kind of ranking opens up the use of certain other statistical methods.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 8\n",
    "\n",
    "**a**. For the first part of the exercise, let's eliminate categorical variables, and *impute* missing values with pandas. Write a function to drop all categorical variables from the data set, and return two pandas data frames:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A data frame with all categorical items and a user-specified response column removed.\n",
    "2. A data frame that contains only the response column."

    "Now, we're going to train a linear regression model. This is likely the most widely used model for fitting data out there today - you've probably seen it before, maybe even used it in Excel. The goal of linear modeling, is to fit a **linear equation** that maps a set of **input features** to a numerical **response**. This equation is called a **model**, and can be used to make predictions about the response of similar input features. For example, imagine we have a dataset of electricity prices ($p$) and outdoor temperature ($t$), and we want to predict, given temperature, what electricity price will be. A simple way to model this is with an equation that looks something like $p = basePrice + factor*t$. When we **fit** a model, we are estimating the parameters ($basePrice$ and $factor$) that best fit our data. This is a very simple linear model, but you can easily imagine extending this to situations where you need to estimate several parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Note**: It is possible to fill a semester with linear models (and classes in other departments do!), and there are innumerable issues to be aware of when you fit linear models, so this is just the tip of the iceberg - don't dismiss linear models outright based on your experiences here!\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear model models the data as a **linear combination** of the model and its weights. Typically, the model is written with something like the following form: $y = X\\theta + \\epsilon$, and when we fit the model, we are trying to find the value of $\\theta$ that minimizes the **loss** of the model. In the case of regression models, the loss is often represented as $\\sum (y - X\\theta)^2$ - or the squared distance between the prediction and the actual value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, `X` refers to the the training features, `y` refers to the training response, `Xv` refers to the validation features and yv refers to the validation response. Note that `X` is a matrix (or a `DataFrame`) with the shape $n \\times d$ where $n$ is the number of examples and $d$ is the number of features in each example, while `y` is a vector of length $n$ (one response per example).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal with this assignment is to accurately estimate the number of plays a song will get based on the features we know about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The score we'll be judging the models on is called $R^2$, which is a measure of how well the model fits the data. It can be thought of roughly as the percentage of the variance that the model explains. \n",

    "###2.3 Linear Modeling with Categorical Variables: One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear models expect **numbers** for input features. But we have some features that we think could be useful that are **discrete** or **categorical**. How do we represent these as numbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "One solution is something called one-hot encoding. Basically, we map a discrete space to a vector of binary indicators, then use these indicators as numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I had an input column that could take on the values {$RED$, $GREEN$, $BLUE$}, and I wanted to model this with one-hot-encoding, I could use a map:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $RED = 001$\n",
    "* $GREEN = 010$\n",
    "* $BLUE = 100$\n",
    "\n",
    "We use this representation instead of traditional binary numbers to keep these features independent of one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've established this representation, we replace the columns in our dataset with their one-hot-encoded values. Then, we can fit a linear model on the data once it's encoded this way!\n",
    "\n",
    "Statisticians and econometricians call these types of binary variables *dummy variables*, but we're going to call it one-hot encoding, because that sounds cooler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn has functionality to transform values to this encoding built in, so we'll leverage that. The functionality is called `DictVectorizer` in scikit-learn. The idea is that you feed a `DictVectorizer` a bunch of examples of your data (that's the `vec.fit` line), and it builds a map from a categorical variable to a one-hot encoded vector like we have in the color example above. Then, you can use this object to translate from categorical values to sequences of numeric ones as we do with `vec.transform`. In the example below, we fit a vectorizer on the training data and use the same vectorizer on the validation data so that the mapping is consistent and we don't run into issues if the categories don't match perfectly between the two data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Exercise 11\n",
    "**a.** Use the code below to generate new training and validation datasets for the datasets *with* the categorical features in them."

    "There are a couple of ways of dealing with this situation - one of them is called **regularization**, which you might try on your own (see `RidgeRegression` or `LassoRegression` in scikit-learn), another is to use a model which captures **non-linear** relationships between the features and the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such type of model was pioneered here at Berkeley, by the late, great Leo Breiman. These models are called **regression trees**.\n",

    "\n",
    "If we take our temperature example, we might observe a non-linear relationship - electricity gets expensive when it's cold outside because we use the heater, but it also gets expensive when it's too hot outside because we run the air conditioning. \n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree model might dynamically elect to split the data on the temperature feature, and estimate high prices both for hot and cold, with lower prices for more Berkeley-like temperatures.
